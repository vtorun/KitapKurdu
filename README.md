I developed the Bookworm Clone project, a dynamic web application designed for discovering books and creating personalized collections. Leveraging modern technologies such as React, Axios, Bootstrap, Vite, and JSON-Server, I built an engaging and user-friendly platform that makes exploring and organizing books both fun and seamless.
#  Technologies Used
- React: To create the UI
- Axios: To pull data from API
- Bootstrap: For responsive and stylish designs
- Vite: Rapid development environment
- JSON-server: For database management
